Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to connect a **Rust** web application, built with the Actix framework, to a PostgreSQL database using Diesel ORM. It handles insert and get requests efficiently, with performance metrics of approximately **6ms per insert query** and **4ms per get request**, tested via Postman.

The current setup is optimized for scalability, ensuring that future expansions and higher loads can be managed effectively.
